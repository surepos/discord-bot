Intern FAQ - AI Bootcamp 

Here are the next steps (Intern Onboarding). 

1.	IF YOU DIDN’T watch the welcome and onboarding video by Dr. Nancy Li, make sure to watch it now. This is mandatory to know how to be successful during the internship. 

2.	Join our Developer Discord server and complete your server onboarding process. Once you join the server will have pop-ups to guide you through the process. 
●	The first thing you should do after joining discord is to update your profile with your full name and linkedin url.  This is the main way everyone will communicate with you. 
●	Please introduce yourself in the #networking channel and post your techstack in the #techstack channel

3.	Watch past cohort demos [MANDATORY]
●	Summary of Cohort 1 and 2 Demo

●	Example of Cohort 3 Demo (highly recommended)
https://youtu.be/5OZjUtUdbbI?si=iW_JL81H3fjLl0yn

4.	Join our first tech mentor session. Dates will be announced in the Discord channel. Our mentor will give you an overview of how to collaborate in a cross-functional team during the AI project and how to find tech resources. Here is the link to the onboarding and training guide for all interns. Here are the Youtube playlists training referenced in the training guide above. 
a.	Engineers’ Training Playlist
b.	Designers’ Training Playlist

5.	Some of you will be invited to start the team match process early. Product managers will be reaching out to see if you are a good fit for their team to scale their existing AI Products (from a previous cohort). These are group conversations with Anil and PM’s from an existing AI product team. 

6.	There are 2 Team Matching sessions: 
a.	Week 2: Product Managers will pitch to Designers to join their Ai product idea
b.	Week 4: Product Mangers & Designers will create High-Fidelity designs to pitch their Ai product idea to Engineers/Data Scientists.
	      Note: Please look out for discord messages on exact dates. 
It is mandatory that you join these Pitch Day sessions. 

7.	The offer letters will be sent by the support team


If you need visa sponsorship, you must reply to this email and let us know what special things you need to put on the offer letter and what deadlines you have. Please also post the same request in the #visa-sponsorship discord channel. So that we can track the progress. 


IMPORTANT: The best way to communicate with us is on Discord channels and tag Marla for operations questions. Please don’t DM Dr. Nancy Li. Put your questions in the public channel, someone in our team will get back to you.

—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Additional Intern Questions:

1)	What happens in situations when my OPT/CPT dates are 1-month into the program and ends before the next cohort? 
	Example: I’m interested in joining Cohort 5:
●	Cohort #5 = Jun-23-2025  - Sep-12-2025
●	Cohort #6 = Sept-15-2025  - Nov-28-2025
But my OPT/CPT will only allow me to have Start Date = June 23rd and End Date = August 8th. 

Reason: The university has informed me that they cannot approve the current dates listed in the offer letter, as the internship must conclude before the start of the Fall 2025 semester. According to their guidelines, the final allowable date for the internship is August 8, 2025..	

Can I still join a cohort, but not tell my university?  - Can I get in trouble for this situation? 

Answer: If your CPT/OPT date is within 1 week or so around our cohort date. It’s fine. If it cuts off in the middle of the cohort. We have to move you to the future cohort. 

2)	Who will pay for services that require pay during the internship? 
a)	Example - API services or Cloud services for the AI product? 
b)	Example - Need compute for FineTuning a model? 

Answer: Our company or the product managers in the same team will cover the cloud and API cost. But we will not cover the computer device cost. 

3)	I will be traveling to visit my family from the USA to India, China, etc…. Can I use this OPT/CPT work permit for reentry into the USA? 

Answer: We don’t know, please contact your immigration lawyer. 


4)	Standard response for CPT/OPT process in the program: 
For interns' CPT and OPT sponsorship concerns, please follow the steps below:     
**1. Consult Your School First**
Please speak with your school’s international student office to understand their specific requirements for CPT or OPT authorization. They will inform you what documentation or updates are needed from our side (e.g., offer letter, company info, etc.).

**2. Offer Letter Timing**
We are able to revise your offer letter based on your CPT/OPT dates. However, we ask that your start and end dates align as closely as possible with your assigned cohort timeline. A 1–2 week delay is acceptable if there are processing delays, but please keep us informed and send us any updated dates as soon as possible.

**3. E-Verify Requirements**
We will also need your information to validate your eligibility to work in the U.S. through the E-Verify system. Please follow the steps here: https://discord.com/channels/1255183088607297729/1283485753782964316/1293422029298471007

Please make sure to send/share your full legal name in your offer letter. 
- If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask in #visa-sponsorship channel or reach out directly to our support team : Marla.

5)	Do Interns have AI PM Bootcamp Kajabi access? 
- No. Only PMs enrolled in the program have access to our course modules (Kajabi). Interns will have access to their own recorded training/session/files with the link/s that the PMA team will share.

Example: 
- Recent AI Intern recorded training/ onboarding with Mentors Aishwarya Saad Shariff & Anil Thomas: https://youtu.be/O0WJ1LTqhAY
